Most of the resources in this repository will be used in [this subdirectory README](/profile/README.md), which is why the top level README is pretty empty and not a good representation of the current status quo.

This subdirectory will be used by Github to generate the organisationâ€˜s page though. You can find out more [in this FreeCodeCamp blog post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-dot-github-repository/).
