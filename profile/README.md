# Play2Learn

We build simulations and open worlds for students of all ages and backgrounds,
so they can explore, learn, experiment, innovate, and express their
individuality.

The environments we build should be fun to use, assessible by everybody, and built on sustainable and open technology.

We prefer an open licensing model for our content. Non-free and closed contributions need to show how these attributes will benefit the project goals.


## Stack

The goal is a wide framework of supported and integrated open source tools.

To get started, we focus on this stack:

 * Computers: Raspberry Pi - both as development environments and IoT controllers.
 * OS: Linux 
 * Programming Language: Python, Javascript
 * Version Control: Git
 * Editor: Vim
 * UI: HTML5, CSS3, JS
 * Gamedev: Godot
